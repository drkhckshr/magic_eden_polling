# Magic Eden Polling

## Purpose

This is just a demonstration using some of the undocumented ReST API's Magic Eden exposes. The code provided will look for the most recently listed items in any NFT collection on Magic Eden. You can use the API's or the data to build other intesting use cases like tracking average listed price over time for example. Hope you find this project useful!

## Requirements

* Docker
  * [Get Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

The `Dockerfile` will take care of the rest of the dependencies.

## Quick Start

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/drkhckshr/magic_eden_polling.git
```

Build the Docker image

```
cd magic_eden_polling
docker build --tag mepoll .
```

Run the container

```
cd mepoll
docker run --rm  -v `pwd`:/tmp -it mepoll python tmp/src/get_me_nft_collections.py
```

## Usage

To modify what NFT collections to target update the `me_nft_collections.json` file in `mepoll/files`.

The only requirement is to have the `.json` in the following format.

```
[
    {
        "collectionName": "skeleton_crew_skulls"
    },
    {
        "collectionName": "skeleton_crew_airdrops_and_more"
    }
]
```

You can find the collection name in your browser's address bar. 

For example, the `Skeleton Crew Skulls` collection is at

```
https://www.magiceden.io/marketplace/skeleton_crew_skulls
```

In `mepoll/files` you see additional `.json` files with the most recently listed NFTs in each collection.

Each `.json` collection file will follow the naming convention of `me_nft_<collection_name>.json`.

NOTE: Each time the container is run it will overwrite any collection files that were previously generated.
